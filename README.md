In this project, I have created a responsive website where people from around the world can connect with each other, engage in discussions, and have a great time together.

Users can sign up for an account and gain access to various conversation rooms. They have the freedom to create their own rooms, provide descriptions, and join conversations in other rooms as well. Additionally, users can update their profile information, such as their username, password, and bio, to personalize their presence on the platform. They can also add a profile picture (Avatar) to further customize their profiles.

To ensure a secure environment, only the host of a room has the authority to delete messages or delete the room itself. This helps maintain the integrity of conversations and promotes mutual respect among users.

The home page features a search bar where users can easily find rooms based on topics, room names, or descriptions. On the left side, users can explore existing rooms categorized by topics, while the right side displays recent conversations from different rooms.

Overall, this website provides a user-friendly and engaging platform for people to connect, share ideas, and enjoy meaningful discussions in a comfortable virtual setting.
